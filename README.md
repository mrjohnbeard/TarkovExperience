# The Tarkov Experience - Stat Tracker

Welcome to The Tarkov Experience Stat Tracker application. Here, you can view details on every location from Escape from Tarkov.
You can also add your own stats in each location's page, and compare it your stats versus other people in the community. If you 
feel that you no longer want your Raid Stat displayed, you can click on the "X" button and your stat will be removed. Enjoy!

Next Steps: Will be adding a feature that will give the average of the property input (ammo used, bullets hit, etc;). Also interested
in having users submit image along with the stats. Possibly add a seperate page for all images submitted, either per location, or whole.
